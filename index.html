			<p>
				Hi Diddly Ho Neighborino! And WELCOME to Max Power's Simpsons Episode Showcase. Here you will find blurry, out-of-context still frame images and typo-ridden quotations, all hand-picked from a completely subjective list of the author's favorite episodes! So if you, too, gentle visitor, like to reminisce on clichéd American sitcoms that JUST DON'T KNOW when to call it quits already, strap yourself in and feel the G's!
